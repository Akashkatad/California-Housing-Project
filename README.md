<h1>California Housing Data Analysis</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>In this project, we analyze a dataset containing information about housing in California. The dataset provides various features related to housing, including median income, housing median age, total bedrooms, median house values, ocean proximity, and more. Our goal is to explore and analyze this dataset to gain insights into California's housing market. We will use Python and data visualization libraries to answer specific questions and provide explanations for our findings.</p>

<h2>Questions:</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>What is the average median income of the data set and check the distribution of data using appropriate plots?</strong><br>
    Please explain the distribution of the plot.</li>
  <li><strong>Draw an appropriate plot to see the distribution of housing_median_age and explain your observations.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Show with the help of visualization, how median_income and median_house_values are related?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Create a data set by deleting the corresponding examples from the data set for which total_bedrooms are not available.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Create a data set by filling the missing data with the mean value of the total_bedrooms in the original data set.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Write a programming construct (create a user-defined function) to calculate the median value of the data set wherever required.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Plot latitude versus longitude and explain your observations.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Create a data set for which the ocean_proximity is 'Near ocean'.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Find the mean and median of the median income for the data set created in question 8.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Please create a new column named total_bedroom_size. If the total bedrooms are 10 or less, it should be quoted as small. If the total bedrooms are 11 or more but less than 1000, it should be medium, otherwise, it should be considered large.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>The project includes Python code, data visualization, and explanations for each step to ensure a clear understanding of the dataset and the insights gained from the analysis.</p>
